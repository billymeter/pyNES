<H2>What Is Covered And What Not?</H2>
  This document covers NES memory layout, I/O ports, video controller
(PPU), sound hardware, and the most videly used memory switching
circuits (mappers). It also describes the .NES file format.
<P>
  The 6502 CPU used in NES is not covered in this document though, as
there is enough information on it in other literature. You are assumed
to know how 6502 works.
<P>
  Also not covered are some more exotic memory mappers, Famicom
DiskSystem, and some other esoteric pieces of hardware, as I don't have
enough information about them. If you have any information on NES which
is not in this manual, feel free to write to
<A HREF="mailto:marat@komkon.org">marat at server komkon dot org</A>.
Your help will be appreciated. 
<P>
  In this manual, you may encounter notation of the form <I>"Nth bit"</I>
(5th, 3rd, etc.). Bits are counted from the least significant (0th) to the
most significant (7th).
<P>
  All hexadecimal numbers are prepended with a dollar sign ($2002, $4016,
etc.) which is a common notation used in 6502 CPU assembler.

<A NAME="LABB"></A>
<H2>General Architecture</H2>
  NES is based on the 6502 CPU and a custom video controller known as PPU
(Picture Processing Unit). The PPU's video memory is separated from the
main CPU memory and can be read/written via special ports.
<P>
  Cartridges may contain both ROM appearing in the CPU address space at
$8000-$FFFF, and VROM or VRAM appearing in the PPU address space at
$0000-$1FFF.
<P>
  In smaller cartridges, which only have 16kB ROM, it takes place at
$C000-$FFFF leaving $8000-$BFFF area unused. In cartridges with &gt32kB
ROM, it is paged into address space with special circuitry (see
"<A HREF="#LABK">Mappers</A>"). Some cartridges also have RAM at
$6000-$7FFF which may or may not be battery-backed.
<P>
  Cartridge VROM (VRAM) is used for Pattern Tables (aka Tile Tables,
Character Generators, etc.). The usual amount is 8kB which contain 2
Pattern Tables. In cartridges with &gt8kB VROM (VRAM), it is paged into
address space with special circuitry (see "<A HREF="#LABK">Mappers</A>").
<P>
  Internal NES VRAM is located at addresses $2000-$3FFF in the 
PPU memory and used to store Name Tables (aka Screen Buffers, etc.).
Although PPU supports 4 Name Tables, there is only enough memory for
two of them. Other two mirror the first two (see "<A HREF="#LABH">PPU
Details</A>").

<H2>Interrupts</H2>
  NES uses non-maskable interrupts (NMIs) generated by PPU in the end
of each frame (so-called VBlank interrupts). The VBlank interrupts can be
enabled/disabled by writing 1/0 into 7th bit of $2000.
<P>
  When a VBlank interrupt occurs, CPU pushes return address and the
status register on stack, then jumps to the address stored at location
$FFFA (ROM in NES).
<P>
  The interrupt handler is supposed to finish its execution with RTI
command which returns CPU to the main program execution. More
information on the interrupt handling can be found in a decent book on
6502 CPU. 
<P>
  Maskable interrupts (aka IRQs) can be generated by external circuitry
on the cart (see "<A HREF="#LABK">Mappers</A>"), but most carts do not
generate them.
<HR>

<A NAME="LABI"></A>
<H2>Joysticks</H2>
  Two NES joysticks are accessed via locations $4016 and $4017 accordingly.
To reset joysticks, write first $01 then $00 into $4016. This will generate
a strobe in the joysticks' circuitry. Then read either from $4016 (joystick
#0) or from $4017 (joystick #1). Each consequent read will return the
status of a single button in the 0th bit (1 if pressed, 0 otherwise): 
<FONT COLOR="#000080">
<PRE>

-------+---------------------------------------------------------
<B>Button</B> |    A      B   SELECT   START   UP    DOWN   LEFT  RIGHT
</PRE>
</FONT>
  1st bit indicates whether joystick is connected to the port or not. It
is set to 0 if a joystick is connected, 1 otherwise. 6th and 7th bits of
$4016/$4017 also seem to have some significance. The rest of bits appear
to return zeroes. Some games expect to get <B>exactly</B> $41 from
$4016/$4017 if a button is pressed.
<HR>

<A NAME="LABG"></A>
<H2>PPU Memory</H2>
<OL>

<H3><LI>Accessing PPU Memory</H3>
  In a real NES, reading/writing PPU memory should only be attempted
during VBlank period. Attempts to access PPU memory during screen
refresh will corrupt refresh address registers in a certain way
which is often used to implement "split screen" effects (see
"<A HREF="#LABH">PPU Details</A>").
<P>
  Many smaller ROMs have read-only memory (VROM) for the Pattern Tables.
In this case, you won't be able to write into this part of PPU address
space, only read from it.
<FONT COLOR="#000080">
<PRE> 
<B>Writing to PPU memory:</B>
a) Write upper address byte into $2006
b) Write lower address byte into $2006
c) Write data into $2007. After each write, the
   address will increment either by 1 (bit 2 of
   $2000 is 0) or by 32 (bit 2 of $2000 is 1).
 
<B>Reading from PPU memory:</B>
a) Write upper address byte into $2006
b) Write lower address byte into $2006
c) Read data from $2007. The first byte read from
   $2007 will be invalid (see "PPU Details"). Then,
   the address will increment by 1 after each read.
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>

<H3><LI>Name Tables</H3>
  PPU supports 4 Name Tables at addresses $2000, $2400, $2800, and $2C00.
A Name Table is very similar to the text mode screen buffer which contains
codes of characters to display on the screen. It contains tile (character)
codes organized into 30 rows of 32 bytes each. Tiles are 8x8 pixels each.
Thus, the whole Name Table is 32x30 tiles or 256x240 pixels. On NTSC TVs,
upper and lower 8 pixels are usually shown off screen leaving you with
256x224 pixels. In the PAL standard, the screen is whole 256x240 pixels.
<P>
It is necessary to say that although PPU supports 4 Name Tables, NES only
has enough internal VRAM for 2 Name Tables. Two others are
<A HREF="#LABHA">mirrored</A>.
<P>

<H3><LI>Pattern Tables</H3>
  PPU supports 2 Pattern Tables at addresses $0000 and $1000. A Pattern
Table contains tile images (patterns) in the following format:
<FONT COLOR="#000080">
<PRE>
<B>Character   Colors      Contents of Pattern Table</B>

                            +---------+
</PRE>
</FONT>
  Note that only two bits for each pixel of each tile are stored in the
Pattern Table. Other two are taken from the Attribute Table. Thus, the
total number of simultaneous colors on the NES screen is 16, although
each tile has only 4 colors.
<P>

<H3><LI>Attribute Tables</H3>
  Each Name Table has its own Attribute Table. A byte in this table 
represents a group of 4x4 tiles on screen which makes an 8x8 Attribute
Table. Each 4x4 tile group is subdivided into four 2x2 squares as follows:
<FONT COLOR="#000080">
<PRE> 
(0,0)  (1,0) 0|  (2,0)  (3,0) 1
(0,1)  (1,1)  |  (2,1)  (3,1)
--------------+----------------
(0,2)  (1,2) 2|  (2,2)  (3,2) 3
(0,3)  (1,3)  |  (2,3)  (3,3)
</PRE>
</FONT>
  The attribute byte contains upper two bits of the color number for each
2x2 square (the lower two bits are stored in the Pattern Table): 
<FONT COLOR="#000080">
<PRE> 
<B>Bits   Function                        Tiles</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------
7,6    Upper color bits for square 3   (2,2),(3,2),(2,3),(3,3)    
5,4    Upper color bits for square 2   (0,2),(1,2),(0,3),(1,3)
3,2    Upper color bits for square 1   (2,0),(3,0),(2,1),(3,1)
1,0    Upper color bits for square 0   (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>

<H3><LI>Palettes</H3>
  There are two 16-byte Palettes. The one at $3F00 used for the
picture. Another one, at $3F10, contains sprite colors. The
$3F00 and $3F10 locations in VRAM mirror each other (i.e. it is the
same memory cell) and define the background color of the picture.

<H3><LI>Mirroring</H3>
  As you may have noticed, PPU supports 4 Name Tables with corresponding
Attribute Tables. Nevertheless, there is only enough internal VRAM for
2 Name Tables. Other 2 tables are going to be mirrors of the first 2.

Which pages are mirrored depends on the cartiridge circuitry. Each
cartridge has control of the PPU address bits A10 and A11. It may set them
in one of four possible ways:

<H3><LI>VBlank Flag</H3>
  The VBlank Flag is contained in the 7th bit of the PPU Status Register
($2002). It indicates whether PPU is refreshing the screen or generating a
Vertical Blanking Impulse. It goes up in the end of each frame and stays on
until a next screen refresh starts. When VBlank Flag is up, you can access
PPU memory via $2006/$2007. The program can reset VBlank Flag prematurely
by reading from the PPU Status Register ($2002).
<P>

<H3><LI>Hit Flag</H3>
  The Hit Flag is contained in the 6th bit of the PPU Status Register
($2002). It goes up when PPU starts displaying sprite #0 and its first
non-transparent pixel coincides with the first non-transparent pixel of
the background. For example, if the screen is filled with the
non-transparent color (&gt;0), sprite #0's coordinates are [12,34], and it
only has pixels in the 4th line from the top, then the Hit Flag will be
set when screen refresh reaches location [12,37]. 
<P>
  The Hit Flag allows to implement both horizontal and vertical screen
splits, as well as variety of other interesting effects. It is <B>not</B>
reset by reading from the PPU Status Register. Instead, it appears to go
down on its own every time PPU starts refreshing screen.
<P>

<H3><LI>Accessing VRAM During Refresh</H3>
  As was said before, accessing VRAM address ($2006) and data ($2007)
registers during screen refresh is officially considered illegal. A lot
of programs access these registers to produce various scrolling effects.
For example, if some game has a scrolling playfield and a stationary
status bar at the bottom of the screen, it may write to $2006 at the
first line of the status bar to reset screen scroll.
<P>
  The idea behind this trick is that PPU uses the VRAM address register
to store current address during screen refresh. By writing into $2006
you effectively modify this address and make PPU continue screen refresh
from a different location. Details on how $2007 affects screen refresh
are unknown.
<P>
  While it is not clear <B>how</B> exactly values written into $2006
relate to the screen locations, they seem to follow this diagram:
<FONT COLOR="#000080">

<H2>Sprites</H2>
  There are 64 sprites which can be either 8x8 or 8x16 pixels. Sprite
patterns are stored in one of the Pattern Tables in the PPU Memory. Sprite
attributes are stored in a special Sprite Memory of 256 bytes which is not a
part of neither CPU nor PPU address space. The entire contents of Sprite
Memory can be written via DMA transfer using location $4014 (see above).
Sprite Memory can also be accessed byte-by-byte by putting the starting
address into $2003 and then writing/reading $2004 (the address will be
incremented after each access). The format of sprite attributes is as
follows: 
<FONT COLOR="#000080">

Sprite Attribute RAM:

                    2: Color and attributes:
                       bits 1,0: two upper bits of color

                       bit 6: if 1, flip sprite horizontally
                       bit 7: if 1, flip sprite vertically
                    3: X position of the left-top corner
</PRE>
</FONT>
  Sprite patterns are fetched in the exactly same way as the tile patterns
for the background picture. The only difference occurs in 8x16 sprites:
the top half of a sprite is taken from the Sprite Pattern Table at $0000
while the bottom part is taken from the same location of $1000 Sprite
Pattern Table.

<H2>Memory Mappers</H2>
  There are many different memory mappers (aka MMCs) used in the NES 
cartridges. They are used to switch ROM and VROM pages and for some other 
tasks. I will try to describe all known MMCs. Any new information on these
and other MMCs is highly appreciated. MMC numbers are given in terms of
the "Mapper Type" field in .NES files
(see "<A HREF="#LABM">.NES File Format</A>").

<H2>Famicom Disk System</H2>
  Famicom Disk System (FDS) is a Famicom extension unit which was produced
by Nintendo and only sold in Asian countries. It consists of a disk drive
accepting 2.5" floppies, 32kB of RAM (instead of ROM) to load programs
into, 8kB of VRAM (instead of VROM), and some other hardware described
below. 
<OL>

<H3><LI>IRQ Counter</H3>
  FDS provides a 16bit IRQ counter connected to the CPU clock generator. 
This counter starts from a value preset in $4020-$4021 when you write
into $4021. It will then decrement by one on each CPU clock cycle. When
the counter reaches zero, it reloads from the preset value and continues
counting. An IRQ is generated at this moment. It may occur during VBlank
as well as during screen refresh. The 2nd bit of $4022 allows to control
IRQ counter. When it is set to 0, the counter stops and a pending IRQ
request is reset (if there is such request). The counting can then be
resumed by setting 2nd bit of $4022 to 1.

<H3><LI>Disk Format</H3>
  Each disk has two sides, <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>, each of them containing
exactly 65000 bytes of data. To change an active side, the disk has to be
removed, flipped, and inserted back into the drive. The data on each side
is stored in several types of blocks in a sequence

  All two-byte fields are written with the most significant byte first. 
Side names may be different for different sides of the same game floppy,
but they are usually the same. Starting addresses are actual addresses in
RAM or VRAM where files are loaded. 

<H3><LI>Disk Access</H3>
  Following diagrams show how FDS performs reads and writes from a floppy
disk. These diagrams have been created by Goroh in his document on the FDS
hardware. I am providing them here with only minor cosmetic changes, with
all credit going to Goroh:

</PRE>
</FONT>
  It is not clear from the diagrams how actual reading and writing is
done. It is quite clear though that FDS generates an IRQ every time a byte
is read from the disk. FDS IRQ handler (which is a part of the FDS BIOS)
reads this byte from $4031 while the head is advanced to the next byte. 

<H3><LI>Disk Errors</H3>
  FDS BIOS may display different errors when accessing a floppy disk.
The list of errors given below has been taken from Goroh's document and
verified on an FDS emulator to the best of my abilities. Errors whose
meaning is not clear to me are marked with question marks.

<H2>.NES File Format</H2>
  .NES files are used to store images of NES cartridges for emulators. The
.NES format has been first implemented by me,
<A HREF="../">Marat Fayzullin</A>, in <A HREF="../iNES/">iNES</A> and then
adopted by other emulator authors. It has become a de-facto standard of
storing NES ROM images. Following is the structure of a .NES file: 
<FONT COLOR="#000080">

<B>Byte     Contents</B>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0-3      String "NES^Z" used to recognize .NES files.
4        Number of 16kB ROM banks.
5        Number of 8kB VROM banks.
6        bit 0     1 for vertical mirroring, 0 for horizontal mirroring.
         bit 1     1 for battery-backed RAM at $6000-$7FFF.
         bit 2     1 for a 512-byte trainer at $7000-$71FF.
         bit 3     1 for a four-screen VRAM layout. 
         bit 4-7   Four lower bits of ROM Mapper Type.
7        bit 0     1 for VS-System cartridges.
         bit 1-3   Reserved, must be zeroes!
         bit 4-7   Four higher bits of ROM Mapper Type.
8        Number of 8kB RAM banks. For compatibility with the previous
         versions of the .NES format, assume 1x8kB RAM page when this
         byte is zero.
9        bit 0     1 for PAL cartridges, otherwise assume NTSC.
         bit 1-7   Reserved, must be zeroes!
10-15    Reserved, must be zeroes!
16-...   ROM banks, in ascending order. If a trainer is present, its
         512 bytes precede the ROM bank contents.
...-EOF  VROM banks, in ascending order.

</FONT>
  Note that this format will most likely expand in future, therefore do not
take it for something permanent. All new additions are guaranteed to be
compatible with the older versions of a format though.
<P>
  The 8 bits allocated for the mapper number give us a total of 256
possible mapper types. If you happen to find a new type of a memory mapper,
please, email me its description and several sample ROMs and I will
allocate and announce a new number for it. Do not pick the number yourself,
as this will cause a general mess.
