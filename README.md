pyNES - a Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator
================================================



Our project topic is a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Emulator. The NES Emulator will emulate the 8-bit NES video game console that was released in the US in 1985. We will likely use the pyGame library for graphics, sound, and controller input. We do not expect this to be an easy project, but we are commited to doing it and know that we will learn much along the way! =)



We have several technical resources to use when developing the project, most notably, NESDev.com (http://nesdev.com/).
